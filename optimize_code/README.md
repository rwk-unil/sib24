# Optimize your code

This section provides a few "easy-to-implement" tips and trick to optimize code.

## Python and C optimization notebook

You can access and copy the following Google [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10F_LoZgLSoruaVk5jKzAQ6Mz2PyD3--a?usp=sharing) to follow along.

### Python profiling

In order to measure what to optimize we need to *profile* our code or scripts.

The Research Computing group of University of Leeds provides a Python notebook on profiling as part of their [high performance Python course](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/training/courses/swd6/). It is available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ARCTraining/swd6_hpp/blob/master/docs/01_profiling.ipynb)
